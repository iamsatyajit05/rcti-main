                <p>
                    Welcome to R.C. Technical Institute, Ahmedabad. The R.C. Technical Institute was established by
                    <b>Rao
                        Bahadoor Ranchhodlal Chhotalal </b>(The First Nagarpati and pioneer of textile industry in
                    India) in
                    year 1910 at Saraspur,Ahmedabad. Later in the year 1930, this institute was handed over to the <b>
                        State
                        Government of Bombay.</b>
                </p><br>
                <p>Initially, the institute was running certificate courses in Mechanical, Electrical, Textile Spinning,
                    Textile Weaving and Textile Processing. In the year 1947, these certificate courses were replaced by
                    new
                    Diploma programmes in Textile Manufacturing and Textile Processing.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Looking to the need of industries, the programs like Printing technology, Mechanical Engineering,
                    Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, IT Engineering & Civil etc are added gradually. To
                    accommodate this expansion in environmentally clean and layer area, the institute is shifted to the
                    new
                    campus at sola, Ahmedabad in June 1997.</p>
